CSC 669 Final Project 

In sports, there are large investments from people on a multitude of levels in terms of money and time. From stockholders to players to fans and sports betters, sports attract an immense amount of attention and financial involvement. Recently, sports betting has increased substantially, bringing in even more money and opportunity for financial gain. 

Specifically, March Madness brings more attention and pressure to teams competing, as every team is fighting to keep their season alive. In turn, fans get more involved with the higher stakes, and subsequentially, betting increases. Many apps offer bracket competitions, and these ‘bracket pools’ have become a staple in almost every office environment across the country. Thus, any measure of prediction that would give indication of a team’s outlook on a season would have many different implications, in terms of fans, sports betters, and even coaches.  

Throughout this research, I will develop and train a model that has the ability to make informed game predictions leading to financial gain, give coaches information about the most important attributes that contribute to a team’s season’s success, and provide insight on the outlook of a team’s future season, with potential to alter recruit’s decisions. 

My model will be able to predict how far a team will advance in the NCAA Tournament (e.g. None, R64, R32, S16, E8, F4, 2ND, Champion), by taking into account, and weighing various statistical efficiency measures, such as offensive efficiency, field goal efficiency, conference, and seeding.
